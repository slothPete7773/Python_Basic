## What I have learned from these workshops

1. Perform data exploration, with predefined tasks, to get to know the characteristics of data.
2. Clean data, although it is just filter out with 1 column.
3. Output the data to a text file.
4. Just know Python's `filter()`, `groupby()`, and `itemgetter()` 

    - `filter()` : Filter method for filtering the list with function with boolean result.
    - `groupby()` : Pure Python grouping method, 
    - `itemgetter()`
